# thinking_with_timmy
My First Repository

Hello Everyone!

My name is Timmy Ahlstrom, a data analytics consultant based out of San Francisco.  I created this blog to entertain me during these tough Coronoa Virus times.  THe objective of this blog is to highlight my passion for advanced analytics and demonstrate my mastery of the subject.  I plan on having my analysis' being industry agnostic to show, regardless of type of data, I can find product, market, and customer insights.

In my 3 years with Accenture, I have worked for several fortune 500 companies by leading E2E delivery of business transformations, developing product & customer marketing strategies, and identifying data segments to craft business segmentation strategies and cases 


If you find this work interesting or would like to collaborate in the future, please do not hesistate to reachout.

Now sit back, relax, and enjoy thinking with Timmy.

Cheers,
Timmy
